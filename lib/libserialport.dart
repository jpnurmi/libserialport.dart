/// # Introduction
///
/// Serial Port for Dart is based on
/// [libserialport](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Libserialport), which is a minimal
/// C-library created by the [sigrok](http://sigrok.org/) projects, and released
/// under the LGPL3+ license.
///
/// # Import
///
///     import 'serial_port/serial_port.dart'
///
/// # Getting Started
///
/// - [SerialPort]
///   - obtaining a list of serial ports on the system
///   - opening, closing and getting information about ports
///   - signals, modem control lines, breaks, etc.
///   - low-level reading and writing data
/// - [SerialPortConfig]
///   - baud rate, parity, etc.
/// - [SerialPortReader]
///   - high-level data stream for reading data asynchronously
///
/// # Debugging
///
/// The library can output extensive tracing and debugging information. The
/// simplest way to use this is to set an environment variable
/// `LIBSERIALPORT_DEBUG` to any value; messages will then be output to the
/// standard error stream.
///
/// No guarantees are made about the content of the debug output; it is chosen
/// to suit the needs of the developers and may change between releases.
